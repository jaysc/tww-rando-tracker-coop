# TWW Randomizer Tracker Coop

This is a online synchronized tracker for [The Wind Waker Randomizer](https://github.com/LagoLunatic/wwrando). You can create an online room where the tracker will be synced with all connected clients (items and locations).

This tracker is based on source code written by [wooferzfg](https://github.com/wooferzfg). You can find the original tracker at [wooferzfg.me/tww-rando-tracker](https://www.wooferzfg.me/tww-rando-tracker/).

## Build Instructions

Building and running the tracker locally requires you to [install Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

After installing Node and cloning the repository, install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install --force
```
You can then build and serve the tracker application:
```bash
npm start
```
After the server starts, you can go to http://localhost:8080/ to open the tracker.
